# Built-in Tools

Resonant ships a set of tools your agent can use via Bash during conversations. These extend beyond Claude Code's native tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob) with conversation-aware capabilities.

Tools are accessed through `tools/sc.mjs` — a CLI that wraps Resonant's internal API. The agent's orientation context includes the full command reference on every message, so it knows what's available.

All commands auto-detect the current thread from `.resonant-thread` (written per-query). Port is read from `resonant.yaml`.

## Chat Tools

### Share Files
Share a file from disk into the current chat thread. Appears as a message with the file attached.

```bash
sc share /absolute/path/to/file
```

### Canvas
Create or update collaborative documents alongside chat.

```bash
sc canvas create "Title" /path/to/file.md markdown
sc canvas create-inline "Title" "short text content" text
sc canvas update CANVAS_ID /path/to/file
```

Content types: `markdown`, `code`, `text`, `html`

### Reactions
React to messages with emoji. Uses offset-based targeting — no message IDs needed.

```bash
sc react last "❤️"              # React to last message
sc react last-2 "🔥"            # React to 2nd-to-last
sc react last "❤️" remove       # Remove a reaction
```

### Voice
Send a text-to-speech message using ElevenLabs. Supports tone tags for expressive delivery.

```bash
sc voice "[whispers] hey [sighs] I missed you"
```

Tone tags: `[whispers]` `[softly]` `[excited]` `[laughs]` `[sighs]` `[playfully]` `[calm]` `[gasps]` `[dramatically]` `[deadpan]` `[cheerfully]` `[nervous]` `[mischievously]`

Requires `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` in `.env`.

## Semantic Search

Search conversation history by meaning using local ML embeddings. No external API calls — runs entirely on your machine.

```bash
sc search "what did we talk about last week"
sc search "that architecture discussion" --thread THREAD_ID
sc search "query" --limit 5
```

Returns matched messages with surrounding conversation context (2 messages before and after each match).

### Backfill

New messages are embedded automatically. To index existing history:

```bash
sc backfill start                  # Background indexing (50/batch, 5s interval)
sc backfill start 100 3000         # Custom batch size and interval (ms)
sc backfill status                 # Check progress
sc backfill stop                   # Halt background indexing
```

See [semantic-search.md](semantic-search.md) for setup and technical details.

## Scheduling

### Orchestrator
Control the autonomous wake schedule. The orchestrator triggers your agent at configured times with specific prompts.

```bash
sc schedule status                 # Show all schedules
sc schedule enable                 # Enable orchestrator
sc schedule disable                # Disable orchestrator
sc schedule reschedule morning_anchor "0 8 * * *"   # Reschedule a wake
```

Wake types depend on your `resonant.yaml` orchestrator config and `wake-prompts.md`.

### Timers
One-shot scheduled reminders. Fire once at a specific time.

```bash
sc timer create "label" "context" "2026-03-21T15:00:00Z"
sc timer create "label" "context" "fireAt" --prompt "wake text"
sc timer list
sc timer cancel TIMER_ID
```

`fireAt` is ISO 8601 UTC. Fires within ~60 seconds of the target time. The optional `--prompt` sets the text used to wake the agent when the timer fires.

### Impulses
One-shot, condition-based triggers. Fire once when all conditions are met, then auto-complete.

```bash
sc impulse create "label" --condition presence_state:active --prompt "tell them X"
sc impulse create "label" --condition time_window:18:00 --condition routine_missing:meal:14 --prompt "remind about food"
sc impulse create "label" --condition agent_free --prompt "journal entry"
sc impulse list
sc impulse cancel TRIGGER_ID
```

### Watchers
Recurring, cooldown-protected triggers. Fire repeatedly whenever conditions are met, with a minimum interval between firings.

```bash
sc watch create "label" --condition presence_transition:offline:active --prompt "Good morning" --cooldown 480
sc watch create "label" --condition presence_state:active --condition time_window:13:00 --prompt "check in" --cooldown 120
sc watch list
sc watch cancel TRIGGER_ID
```

`--cooldown` is in minutes (default 120). Prevents the watcher from firing again too soon.

### Condition Reference

All conditions are AND-joined — every condition must be true for the trigger to fire.

| Condition | Syntax | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Presence state | `presence_state:active` | User is currently in the given state |
| Presence transition | `presence_transition:offline:active` | User just transitioned between states |
| Agent free | `agent_free` | No query currently running |
| Time window | `time_window:18:00` | Current time is after HH:MM |
| Time window (range) | `time_window:09:00:17:00` | Current time is between start and end |
| Routine missing | `routine_missing:meal:14` | Named routine hasn't been logged since hour N |

## Telegram Tools

Available when the user is on Telegram. These appear in the agent's context automatically.

```bash
sc tg photo /path/to/image.png "caption"
sc tg photo --url "https://..." "caption"
sc tg doc /path/to/file.pdf "caption"
sc tg gif "search query" "optional caption"     # Searches GIPHY
sc tg react last "❤️"
sc tg react last-2 "🔥"
sc tg voice "text with [tone tags]"
sc tg text "proactive message"
```

## Command Center MCP Tools

When `command_center.enabled` is true, 13 tools are available via the MCP endpoint at `/mcp/cc`. The companion uses these to manage life data from chat.

| Tool | Actions | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `cc_status` | — | Aggregated dashboard: tasks, events, care, cycle, pets, countdowns, wins |
| `cc_task` | add, list, complete, update, delete | Task management with projects and priorities |
| `cc_project` | add, list, update, delete | Project management with deadlines and colors |
| `cc_care` | set, get, history | Wellness tracking (toggles, ratings, counters, notes) |
| `cc_event` | add, list, update, delete | Calendar events with recurrence |
| `cc_cycle` | status, history, predict, start_period, end_period, log | Cycle tracking with phase predictions |
| `cc_pet` | add, list, update, log, med_add, med_given, upcoming | Pet care with medication schedules |
| `cc_list` | create, view, list_all, add, check, delete_list, delete_item, clear | Shopping and general lists |
| `cc_expense` | add, list, stats | Expense tracking with category breakdown |
| `cc_countdown` | add, list, delete | Countdown timers to events |
| `cc_scratchpad` | status, add_note, add_task, add_event, remove_note, remove_task, clear_notes | Persistent scratchpad — notes and tasks stay until removed |
| `cc_daily_win` | — | Record one win per person per day |
| `cc_presence` | get, set | Presence status with emoji and label |

All tools accept JSON parameters via the MCP protocol. The companion's hooks system automatically includes CC status in its orientation context.

## The Scribe (Digest Agent)

A background agent that runs every 30 minutes on Haiku, producing structured daily digests of conversation. Digests are saved to `data/digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Each digest block extracts:
- **Topics & Themes** — categorized by work, personal, health, creative, etc.
- **Key Quotes** — attributed, significant moments
- **Decisions Made** — what was resolved
- **Open Items** — discussed but not actioned (the things that slip through cracks)
- **Ideas & Plans** — "we should..." and "what if..." moments
- **Events & Dates** — anything with a timeline
- **Projects Touched** — what changed, shipped, or broke
- **Emotional Arc** — observable mood shape of the conversation block

### Configuration

- Toggle: set `digest.enabled` to `false` in the config DB to disable
- The Scribe skips runs when the companion is actively processing
- Requires at least 5 new messages since the last digest
- Uses `companion_name` and `user_name` from `resonant.yaml` for speaker labels

---

## Slash Commands

Type `/` in the chat input to open the CommandPalette. Commands are auto-discovered from installed skills and built-in UI commands.

- **UI commands** — executed client-side (e.g., theme toggle, navigation)
- **SDK commands** — passed through to the agent as tool calls

---

## Internal API

All tools wrap localhost-only REST endpoints. These require no authentication — just the request must come from `127.0.0.1`.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/internal/share` | Share files into chat |
| `POST /api/internal/canvas` | Create/update canvases |
| `POST /api/internal/tts` | Text-to-speech |
| `POST /api/internal/react` | Message reactions |
| `POST /api/internal/orchestrator` | Schedule management |
| `POST /api/internal/timer` | Timer CRUD |
| `POST /api/internal/trigger` | Impulse/watcher CRUD |
| `POST /api/internal/telegram-send` | Send to Telegram |
| `POST /api/internal/search-semantic` | Semantic search |
| `POST /api/internal/embed-backfill` | Embedding backfill |

The `sc` CLI is the recommended interface. Direct API access is available for custom integrations.
